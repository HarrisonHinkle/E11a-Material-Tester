# E11a-Material-Tester

This exercise is an opportunity for you to experiment with PBR Textures in Godot. The exercise is based on [Godot 3 Tutorial: PBR Materials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM5j8x71HcE). I will be providing some additional information about PBR Textures as part of today's lecture materials.
